# Game-plans
I am going to make a clicker game that helps put out fires.
The menu is going to be a call back to the games of old.
The win condition is to put out 20 fires.
The lose condition is clicking on the civilians while the building is still on fire.
The background is going to be blue with a smokey touch to it so it can compliment the fire.
